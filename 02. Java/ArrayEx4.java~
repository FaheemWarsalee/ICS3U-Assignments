Program: Array Ex4

Brief Description: Write a program that fills an array of 100 elements with random integers between 1 and 100 
(each number should only be represented once).  Output the arrays in a meaningful way (i.e., identify each 
element #), and so that it fits on the screen.  Focus on making your output algorithm as efficient as possible.

(a)  Create a second array of the same size.  Copy the elements of the first array into the second array, but in 
reverse order (i.e., element#100 from the 2nd array should match element#1 from the 1st array).Output both 
arrays.  Again, the entire output should fit on a single screen.*/

    System.out.println("\t\t" + (i+1) + "\t\t\t" + hunnet[i]);
