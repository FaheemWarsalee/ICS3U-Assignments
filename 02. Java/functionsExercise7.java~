 * Brief Description : In a leap year, February has 29 days.  A leap year can be determined as follows:
                                        - a year that is divisible by 4 (e.g., 1988, 1992, 1996 are all leap years)
                                        - centennial years (divisible by 100) do not follow this rule (e.g., 1800, 1900 are NOT leap years)
                                        - except centennial years divisible by 400, which are leap years (e.g., 2000 is a leap year)
                                        (a) Create a boolean function that will determine if a given year is a leap year by returning true or false for a given year.
