/* Name : Faheem Warsalee
 * Program : IPO EXERCISE 2 
 * Course : ICS3U
 * Date : 2018
 * Brief Description : Many advanced calculators have a fraction feature that will simplify fractions for you.  You are to write a program that will accept for 
 * input a positive or negative integer as a numerator and a positive integer as a denominator, and output the fraction in simplest form. That is, the fraction 
 * cannot be reduced any further, and the numerator will be less than the denominator. You can assume that all input numerators and denominators will produce
 * valid fractions.  Remember the div and mod operators.
    Implement this by writing a procedure that takes in a numerator and denominator, and 
    returns an integer, a new reduced numerator and denominator (i.e., it can change the input parameters).  
    You may also use a combination of functions and procedures for other features in your program.
