 Program: Couted Loop Exercise 6
 Programmer: Faheem Warsalee
 Course: ICS3U
 Date: March 7th 2018

 Brief Description:(a) [Challenge] Ask the user to input a number between 1 and 99, and then tell the user how many "tens" and how many "ones" in their number.
Extension:
(b) Increase the scope of the program to include "hundreds" and allow inputs from 1 to 999
(c) Improve your output to avoid any grammatical errors (i.e., say "11 has 1 ten and 1 one", not "1 has 1 tens and 1 ones")
(d) Further improve your output to avoid any "zero" statements (i.e., say "7 has 7 ones", not "7 has 0 tens and 7 ones")
(e) Let the user specify how many numbers they will enter
